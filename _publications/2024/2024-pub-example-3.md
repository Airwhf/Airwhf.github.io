  The Modular Emission Inventory Allocation Tool for Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (MEIAT-CMAQ) refines emission inventories by providing detailed spatial (horizontal and vertical), temporal, and species allocations, enhancing the accuracy of CMAQ performance. Its efficient algorithm and modular design offer flexibility for managing both gridded and tabulated inventories, widely used in various sectors. In addition, the shapefiles with specific shapes supported by MEIAT-CMAQ can address the allocation challenges in transportation emissions. The evaluation of MEIAT-CMAQ, using model-ready inventories before (BASE scenario), and after allocation without (EXPR scenario) or with (EXPR-V scenario) vertical allocation, demonstrates significant improvements in the mean bias (MB) of gaseous pollutants (O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, CO). In both the EXPR and EXPR-V scenarios, the MB for O<sub>3</sub> exhibits notable enhancements, with respective improvements of 5.7% and 26.9%. For NO<sub>2</sub>, corresponding MB improvements are even more pronounced, reaching 27.6% and 61.7% in the EXPR and EXPR-V scenarios, respectively. Likewise, enhancements are observed in the MBs of CO, demonstrating increases of 8.4% and 45.2% in the EXPR and EXPR-V scenarios, respectively. Moreover, with regard to spatial accuracy, the incorporation of the MEIAT-CMAQ model yields significant improvements. Specifically, in the EXPR scenarios, spatial accuracy for O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> demonstrates respective enhancements of 13.5% and 9.5%. Furthermore, the inclusion of vertical allocation leads to additional enhancements in CO, NO<sub>2</sub>, and PM<sub>2.5</sub>, resulting in improvements of 17.6%, 16.6%, and 23.2%, respectively. MEIAT-CMAQ provides an efficient method for transforming coarse-resolution emission inventories into high-resolution files directly useable in the model, offering enhanced flexibility for users to select any period for generating model-ready emission files. This capability provides substantial technical support for automating processes within business departments and significantly improves the performance of high-resolution modeling and forecasting.
