  Despite significant advancements in improving the dataset for biomass burning (BB) emissions over the past few decades, uncertainties persist in BB aerosol emissions, impeding the accurate assessment of simulated aerosol optical properties (AOPs) and direct radiative forcing (DRF) during wildfire events in global and regional models. This study assessed AOPs (including aerosol optical depth (AOD), aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD), and aerosol extinction coefficients (AECs)) and DRF using eight independent BB emission inventories applied to the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) during the BB period (March 2019) in peninsular Southeast Asia (PSEA), where the eight BB emission inventories were the Global Fire Emissions Database version 4.1s (GFED), Fire INventory from NCAR version 1.5 (FINN1.5), the Fire Inventory from NCAR version 2.5 MOS (MODIS fire detections; FINN2.5 MOS), the Fire Inventory from NCAR version 2.5 MOSVIS (MODIS + VIIRS fire detections; FINN2.5 MOSVIS), Global Fire Assimilation System version 1.2s (GFAS), Fire Energetics and Emissions Research version 1.0 (FEER), Quick Fire Emissions Dataset version 2.5 release 1 (QFED), and Integrated Monitoring and Modelling System for Wildland FIRES project version 2.0 (IS4FIRES), respectively. The results show that in the PSEA region, organic carbon (OC) emissions in the eight BB emission inventories differ by a factor of about 9 (0.295–2.533 Tg M−1), with 1.09 ± 0.83 Tg M−1 and a coefficient of variation (CV) of 76 %. High-concentration OC emissions occurred primarily in savanna and agricultural fires. The OC emissions from the GFED and GFAS are significantly lower than the other inventories. The OC emissions in FINN2.5 MOSVIS are approximately twice as high as those in FINN1.5. Sensitivity analysis of AOD simulated by WRF-Chem to different BB emission datasets indicated that the FINN scenarios (v1.5 and 2.5) significantly overestimate AOD compared to observation (VIIRS), while the other inventories underestimate AOD in the high-AOD (HAOD; AOD > 1) regions range from 15–22.5∘ N, 97–110∘ E. Among the eight schemes, IS4FIRES and FINN1.5 performed better in terms of AOD simulation consistency and bias in the HAOD region when compared to AERONET sites. The AAOD in WRF-Chem during the PSEA wildfire period was assessed, using satellite observations (TROPOMI) and AERONET data, and it was found that the AAOD simulated with different BB schemes did not perform as well as the AOD. The significant overestimation of AAOD by FINN (v1.5 and 2.5), FEER, and IS4FIRES schemes in the HAOD region, with the largest overestimation for FINN2.5 MOSVIS. FINN1.5 schemes performed better in representing AAOD at AERONET sites within the HAOD region. The simulated AOD and AAOD from FINN2.5 MOSVIS always show the best correlation with the observations. AECs simulated by WRF-Chem with all the eight BB schemes trends were consistent with CALIPSO in the vertical direction (0.5 to 4 km), demonstrating the efficacy of the smoke plume rise model used in WRF-Chem to simulate smoke plume heights. However, the FINN (v1.5 and 2.5) schemes overestimated AECs, while the other schemes underestimated it. In the HAOD region, BB aerosols exhibited a daytime shortwave radiative forcing of −32.60 ± 24.50 W m−2 at the surface, positive forcing (1.70 ± 1.40 W m−2) in the atmosphere, and negative forcing (−30.89 ± 23.6 W m−2) at the top of the atmosphere. Based on the analysis, FINN1.5 and IS4FIRES are recommended for accurately assessing the impact of BB on air quality and climate in the PSEA region.
