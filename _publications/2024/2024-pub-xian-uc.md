  In this study, the WRF-CMAQ model integrated with BEM urban canopy model was used to simulate the concentrations of Ozone ( O<sub>3</sub> ) and its precursors, NO<sub>x</sub>, and VOCs, in warm season of Chengdu, conduct source apportionment and formation analysis. The results show that the O<sub>3</sub> in Chengdu exhibits a west-high/east-low spatial pattern, attributable to nearly 40% contribution from boundary sources representing the transport role of the Sichuan Basin, regional sources from districts emitting high precursor concentrations, and increasing biogenic contributions from western areas due to rising BVOCs emissions during the warm season. NO<sub>x</sub> from traffic and VOCs from industrial sources, both prevalent in Chengdu's high urban density areas, chemically react to form O<sub>3</sub>, making these sectors primary contributors to O<sub>3</sub>. NO<sub>x</sub> photochemical reactions producing O<sub>3</sub> occur at 150 m–2500 m with peak generation rates of 10 μg/(m<sup>3</sup>·hr). Ground-level NO titration removal is most significant during heavy traffic (14:00–21:00), ranging from −70 to −200 μg/(m<sup>3</sup>·hr). O<sub>3</sub> is replenished through similar rates of daytime vertical diffusion and nighttime horizontal advection, correlating with urban density across regions. Controlling Chengdu's warm season O<sub>3</sub> requires focusing on long-distance external transport and regional precursor emission reductions, with strategies tailored to local urban characteristics.
